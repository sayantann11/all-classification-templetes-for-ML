## Introduction
Classification is a type of supervised learning that predicts the class or category of a data point. It is best used when the output variable is discrete. This repository explores different classification algorithms and their implementation using Python.

## Classification Algorithms

### Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is used for binary classification problems. It models the probability distribution of the output variable using a sigmoid function.

### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
KNN is a simple, instance-based learning algorithm that assigns a data point to the class of its nearest neighbors.

### Support Vector Machines (SVM)
SVMs are powerful classifiers that find the hyperplane which best separates the classes. They can handle linear and non-linear data using kernel tricks.

### Naive Bayes Classifier
Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' Theorem. It assumes independence between features given the class label.

### Decision Tree Classifier
Decision Trees classify data by splitting it into subsets based on feature values, creating a tree of decisions.

### Random Forest Classifier
Random Forests are ensembles of Decision Trees, which improve classification accuracy by reducing overfitting.

## Use Cases
- **Spam Detection**: Classifying emails as spam or ham.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Identifying different customer segments based on purchase behavior.
- **Loan Approval**: Predicting if a bank loan should be granted.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Classifying social media posts as positive or negative.

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ml-classification-algorithms.git
cd ml-classification-algorithms
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Examples of using each classifier can be found in the `examples` directory. Each example includes data loading, model training, and prediction.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from logistic_regression import LogisticRegressionModel

# Load dataset
X, y = load_data('dataset.csv')

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize and train model
model = LogisticRegressionModel()
model.train(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}')
```
